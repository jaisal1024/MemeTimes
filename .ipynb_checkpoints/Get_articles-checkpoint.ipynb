      "Ms. Trump and her husband, Mr. Kushner, have had a veteran Washington lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, working with them for several months. But Mr. Trump is famously frugal about hiring personal lawyers, and it is unclear whether he or his adult sons are prepared for how much assistance they will require.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Politically speaking, this is the Achilles’ heel of the administration,” said Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a Democrat who sits on two of the key investigative panels, referring to the Trump family’s business dealings. “They have turned the government of the United States into a moneymaking operation for the president and his family and close friends. That is the exact opposite of our constitutional design.”\n",

On the other hand, people close to them noted that they might be shielded by executive privilege in some instances, whereas the president’s adult sons, who do not serve in the administration, are not.\n",

      "Democrats have said they will not reflexively file subpoenas, but they have already gotten signals from the White House that cooperation is likely to be minimal. Even if the Mueller investigation ends in the coming months, as Mr. Trump’s lawyers believe is possible, the White House is facing a string of congressional subpoenas that could grind the gears of government to a halt, and put a spotlight on areas that the secretive Mr. Trump prefers to keep out of sight.\n",

      "In response, the United States Customs and Border Protection agency shut down the border crossing in both directions and fired tear gas to push back migrants from the border fence. The border was reopened later Sunday evening.\n",

      "Mr. Trump has made preventing caravan members from entering into the United States a signature stance of his administration over the past few weeks and has sent American soldiers to the border, although the United States military was not involved in Sunday’s clash.

      "In light of Friday’s report, Mr. Brinkley drew a parallel between Mr. Trump’s statements on climate science and President Lyndon B. Johnson’s false statements to the American public a half-century ago about the Vietnam War. “Johnson used to tell people everything was going well in Vietnam, and then you’d turn on the news and see the mayhem,” he said. “It was this giant disconnect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In interviews with about a dozen authors of the climate assessment, all said that White House officials had not sought to soften or weaken its language.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will give credit where it’s due: No one at the political level did any monkeying around with this,” said Andrew Light, a co-author of the report and a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a Washington research organization. “For all the criticism of the Trump administration quashing climate science, this is one case where they did not do that.”\n",
      "A few days later, we drove north, 20 hours on punishing mountain roads, toward the Malaysian border and the West Kalimantan district of Sintang. There, a meeting was planned with the local county governor, or bupati, to discuss a similar situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "North of Sintang, a grim commercial town of concrete and rebar at a fork in the Kapuas River, two palm plantations were being developed on peatland bogs. These plantations, too, were located on tracts that Indonesian government maps had at one time explicitly labeled protected peatland, which should have placed them under the moratorium on palm development. The maps had since been changed. Yet there was no mistaking that this was peatland: Paths submerged into black goop, teams of dragonflies swarmed over the hot water, reeds and forest grew from their depths. And here came a flatbed truck, carrying an excavator toward the entrance gate, where a guard in a neatly pressed dark blue uniform turned away visitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The permits named two obscure companies, but a villager at the gate told us that he thought both plantations were run by the same company and that it had been clearing the forest for months. It’s not uncommon for Indonesian companies to use layers of subsidiaries to hide their connections to illegal palm operations. “We call them shadow companies,” said Eric Wakker, a founder of Aidenvironment Asia, an environmental consultancy that has investigated the two plantations. Upon further scrutiny, it appeared that the two companies may indeed have been linked to the Salim Group. They shared a business address with a Salim subsidiary in Jakarta and employed the same plantation managers in Kalimantan. Salim was also a buyer of the palm that would come from the Sintang plantations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connection matters because the Salim Group has benefited from more than $1.5 billion in loans and capital from foreign investors, including the American firms BlackRock and Vanguard, and Salim companies have pledged that their palm oil is not a product of recent deforestation or peatland destruction. Satellite images from 2017 confirmed that the forests on the Sintang plantations were now virtually gone. (A Salim Group executive, Mark Wakeford, declined to comment about the Sintang companies.)\n",
      "\n",
      "At the bupati’s house, an elegant, 19th-century Dutch-built compound bursting with tropical flowers, I pressed him to explain how these peatland forests could be cut down when the government insisted that such land clearing had stopped. The bupati, a doctor named Jarot, had moved to Borneo from Java and had developed a local reputation as a conservationist. He greeted us jovially, barefoot and dressed in bluejeans and a crisp, untucked blue button-down shirt. He said the rural districts must balance economic growth with sustainability, and while he has pledged to control corruption and illegal permits, he also described himself as helpless against the currents of a central government that is close to the big corporations and constantly changes both the rules and the playing field. United Nations forest programs pay communities to leave their trees in the ground. Such funding would help him strike a better balance here, he said, casually shrugging off the plantation case I asked about. “We do what we can do,” Jarot said. “We cannot do it by ourselves. ... We need a fiscal incentive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "An aide offered a more nuanced explanation. The phrases “peatland” and “forest” have distinct legal meanings in Indonesia, he claimed; not all treed areas are forests, and not all peat-filled bogs are peatland. In the strictest legal sense, he was correct. The Sintang regency alone, according to Indonesian government estimates, contains more than 160,000 acres of old-growth, heavily treed land that it has not designated as “forest” under the law and more than 86,000 acres of nondesignated peatland. After a request from the companies, the government maps for Sintang were revised to change the peatland borders. New maps show the bog boundaries tracing perfect 90-degree angles and straight lines — lines that happen to match the boundaries of the companies’ land holdings. How do you account for such details in a life-cycle analysis?\n",

      "(CNN) The Mississippi Senate runoff was expected to be a quiet finale to the 2018 election season but instead has turned into a nationally watched affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while her statements and actions may make Tuesday's special Senate election a closer affair than it might otherwise have been, make no mistake: she is a heavy favorite against Democrat Mike Espy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mississippi is as red as they come. It hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter won the state in 1976. The last Democrat elected to the Senate was John Stennis in 1982. The last Democrat elected governor was Ronnie Musgrove in 1999.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mississippi's redness showed no sign of abating when voters went to the polls earlier this month. Republicans Hyde-Smith and Chris McDaniel combined for 58% of the vote in the jungle primary, while Democrats Tobey Bartee and Espy combined for 42%. That doesn't look very different from Republican President Donald Trump's 18-point 2016 victory in the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shouldn't be too surprising that there wasn't much movement off the 2016 baseline. Mississippi Democrats seem to have a low ceiling in Senate elections. No Democrat has come closer than 8 points to a Republican in the last 30 years. Only two Democrats have come within single digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats' inability to come close is in large part because they can't win over white voters in the state. Mississippi voters are highly polarized along racial lines. According to the 2018 exit poll , Bartee and Espy combined won only 16% of the white vote in the first round of the special election. They took 94% of the black vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem for Democrats is this a pattern seen over and over again. Voters just don't shift that much in the state. In the closest Senate race in the state of the last 20 years, Musgrove earned 18% of the white vote and 92% of the black vote in the 2008 special Senate election . He lost overall by 10 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put another way, Espy needs to break the mold in some way. He can, for instance, win over more white voters than the traditional Mississippi Democrat does. Even if you assume Hyde-Smith's recent comments allow Espy to capture 98% of the black vote, he'll need to win north of 22% of the white vote to emerge victorious given traditional turnout patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's not much of a sign that will happen. After proportionally allocating undecideds, Espy is averaging only around 16% to 17% of the white vote in polling for the runoff over the last few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of that polling, it's been limited but consistent . Hyde-Smith has averaged a low double-digit lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there just hasn't been that much polling. Only one public poll was taken and released in the final 21 days of the campaign. (More polls were taken before that.) Based on Senate elections since 1998, the true margin of error (i.e. 95% confidence interval) is +/- 13 points for any one poll in this final 21-day period . That means this race is technically within the margin of error.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're also talking about a special election the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. This is not the type of election most pollsters are used to polling, or the type of election for which there is a lot of historical precedent. The inability to model off past elections is why special Senate election polling has historically been less accurate than for other Senate elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Espy's best hope is for turnout patterns to change from the first round. There is precedent for this. The percentage of African-Americans as part of the electorate rose between the first round and runoff in the last two midterm Senate runoffs in next door Louisiana. We also saw a spike in black turnout in the Alabama special Senate election last year, which was also not held on Election Day. Because of Mississippi's highly polarized racial voting patterns, Hyde-Smith's margin shrinks more than a point for every extra percentage of the electorate black voters makeup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this is still Mississippi. Espy will need to win over a significantly larger percentage of white voters than he did in round one, even if turnout patterns change. I'm unaware of any polling, public or private, to suggest that is likely.\n",

      "New York (CNN Business) General Motors on Monday announced a major restructuring of its global business, saying it will shut production at five facilities in North America and slash its staff. GM will reduce its salaried workforce by 15%, including a quarter of the company's executives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moves are the first big steps in the century-old GM's transformation. The company is reinvesting money away from cars that once dominated America's roadways and putting it into technology it believes will power its future.\n",
      "\n",
      "GM is laying off workers and shutting production to pave the way for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "GM's ( GM ) new motto is \"Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions, Zero Congestion,\" signaling a shift to self-driving, electric vehicles. But the restructuring is also about making cars people want now. Customers are increasingly shunning sedans in favor of SUVs and hatchbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company said the plan would make it more efficient, saving $6 billion a year by the end of 2020. GM said its slimmed down production plan would allow it to share technology across all of its vehicles and reduce the amount of time and workers it takes to build cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future,\" said CEO Mary Barra, in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "GM said it would shut operations at plants in Detroit; Oshawa, Ontario; Warren, Ohio; White Marsh, Maryland; and Warren, Michigan. The plants made sedans that have waned in popularity, including the Chevrolet Volt, Impala and Cruze, the Buick LaCrosse, and the Cadillac CT6 and XTS. GM said it will no longer make those cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of the plants made engines and parts for those cars. The facilities made some trucks, but those trucks are also made in Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company also said it would close three plants outside North America by the end of next year. One of those closures, in South Korea, had been previously announced.\n",

      "The transition will come at the expense of about 8,000 salaried workers, and 6,000 hourly workers will either lose their jobs or be reassigned to other plants. The company last month offered voluntary buyouts for 18,000 salaried workers.\n",

      "The company, which was incorporated in 1908, is performing reasonably well — earnings are up and the balance sheet is healthy. But sales are starting to slip in China and North America, two of GM's biggest and most important markets.\n",

      "But the next automaking leader may not be GM or one of its traditional rivals. Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Apple ( AAPL ), Uber and Tesla ( TSLA ) are leading Silicon Valley's push into the self-driving cars. That's why GM bought Cruise, a separate company with big backing from SoftBank and Honda. GM expects to spend $1 billion on Cruise this year to build the next generation of cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, GM is trying to reinvent how it makes vehicles. It will share more components across cars and make better use of computer models and virtual tools.

      "\n",
      "The dramatic downfall of the iconic global business leader is a tale of bombshell allegations, corporate intrigue and simmering cultural tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 40-year auto industry veteran, Ghosn brought together three big carmakers — Renault ( RNSDF ) of France and Japan's Nissan ( NSANY ) and Mitsubishi Motors ( MMTOF ) — with the aim of rivaling the top dogs: Volkswagen ( VLKAF ), Toyota ( TM ) and General Motors ( GM ).\n",
      "\n",
      "His vision appeared to be working: Ghosn's alliance makes one out of every nine cars sold around the world. But its future has now been cast into doubt after he was arrested in Japan, ousted as chairman of Nissan and Mitsubishi, and sidelined at Renault.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Brazilian-born executive is accused of taking advantage of his position at the top of Nissan, which he ran for more than 15 years. The allegations include concealing millions of dollars of personal income and using company assets for his own benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "As his reputation is trashed and the empire he built comes under strain, Ghosn is stuck in a Tokyo jail cell, facing the prospect of 10 years in prison if convicted. He's yet to respond publicly to the allegations. (Japan's public broadcaster NHK, citing unnamed sources, reported over the weekend that Ghosn has denied the allegations.)\n",
      "\n",
      "What has Ghosn allegedly done?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosn was detained by Tokyo prosecutors last Monday when he reportedly stepped off a flight from Beirut, where he grew up. His arrest followed an internal investigation at Nissan that the company said found \"significant acts of misconduct\" over many years, including understating his income in financial reports and misusing company assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Nissan manufacturing plant in England, part of the global auto empire Ghosn oversaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors allege that he and another Nissan director, Greg Kelly, collaborated to understate Ghosn's income by about 5 billion yen ($44 million) over a five-year period ending in March 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "NHK reported that Ghosn also failed to properly disclose homes that were provided for him by Nissan in four different countries. The broadcaster added that prosecutors suspect Ghosn may have pocketed money that was meant for other Nissan executives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nissan, which hasn't confirmed the details reported by NHK and other Japanese news outlets, has accused Kelly of being the \"mastermind\" behind the scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did we get here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosn was named Nissan CEO in 2001 and is credited with pulling off a stunning turnaround at the company, which was in financial trouble at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, he has engineered deeper integration between Nissan and Renault. Mitsubishi joined the alliance in 2016 after Nissan bought a 34% stake in it. Together, the three companies employ more than 470,000 people in nearly 200 countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the partnership is unequal. Nissan, which is much bigger and sells more vehicles than Renault, holds only a 15% non-voting stake in the French company. Renault holds a much more powerful 43% shareholding in Nissan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In pure monetary terms, Renault has been getting a better deal than Nissan,\" analysts at investment firm SC Capital wrote last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some analysts suggest that this has stirred discontent among Nissan executives, who were also uncomfortable about the possibility of Renault and Ghosn seeking for a full-blown merger.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of analysts and commentators have suggested that Ghosn was the victim of a \"palace coup\" by Nissan executives nervous over how much power he had accumulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked about the coup speculation, a Nissan spokesman said that the company \"believes strongly that the investigation revealed serious misconduct spanning multiple years\" and that the actions it took against Ghosn were \"fully necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What's next for Ghosn?\n",
      "\n",
      "Japanese prosecutors have yet to indict Ghosn, a French citizen who grew up in Lebanon, on any charges. He is being held at a detention center in Tokyo, where prisoners are typically fed basic meals three times a day and sleep on Japanese futons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors on Wednesday received permission to detain Ghosn for a further 10 days as they continue questioning him. He is being given access to his lawyer and to French consular services.\n",
      "\n",
      "His long Nissan career is almost certainly over. Its board members unanimously voted on Thursday night to oust Ghosn as chairman following a lengthy meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The board of directors at Mitsubishi followed suit on Monday, voting unanimously to remove Ghosn as chairman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Renault stopped short of firing Ghosn last week as its chairman and CEO, instead appointing an interim replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the future of the alliance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Nissan and Renault have said Ghosn's arrest won't affect the alliance . Officials from the French and Japanese governments have echoed those sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The long-standing alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,\" Nissan said Thursday after firing Ghosn, adding that it would try to \"minimize the potential impact and confusion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But a great deal of uncertainty remains. Analysts say Ghosn was the force that held the three companies together.\n",
      "\n",
      "A nightmare scenario for Nissan could arise if prosecutors fail to bring a successful case against Ghosn and he returns as Renault chairman. The SC Capital analysts speculated that Ghosn could retaliate by trying to kick Nissan out of the alliance and seeking a tie-up with a bigger rival like GM instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is probably unlikely, as the costs of the alliance failing would be huge. The companies estimate they save over 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) every year by sharing technology and other resources.\n",

The segment opened with Fox News host Ed Henry first admitting the network's obsession with the soon to be member of Congress, stating, \"we talk about her a lot on Fox & Friends Weekend.\" And then Henry led a discussion about the worn-out shoes Ocasio-Cortez used on the campaign trail that will soon become part of Cornell University's new exhibit on women in politics: \"Women Empowered: Fashions from the Front Line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In that conversation, Fox News contributor Campos-Duffy reiterated her fears of socialism and told viewers that Ocasio-Cortez wants to turn America into Venezuela, where people \"don't have shoes on their feet because of what socialism has done to their country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fox News really needs to find another subject to discuss. In fact, after this segment on Friday, Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to respond with the words, \"No, no es amor/ Lo que tú sientes, se llama obsession.\" These lines are lyrics are from the song Obsesión, by Aventura, which translates into English as: \"No, it's not love, what you feel is called obsession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ocasio-Cortez is right on the money. Fox News is obsessed with her. And it appears others in the right-wing media have also caught some of the Ocasio-Cortez derangement syndrome, as they also seemingly cover her every comment\n",
      "\n",
      "So what's driving all of this? Could it be that Fox News is realizing its longtime bogeywomen, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, are losing their luster for their viewers? (I actually enjoy flipping on Fox News on occasion because on that network it appears that Hillary Clinton is president.) Given that the Democrats won the most House seats this past election than in any year since 1974 , using Pelosi to scare Fox News viewers into action doesn't seem to work anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, does Fox News's Ocasio-Cortez obsession come from a darker place? Some call it \" white anxiety ,\" while others, like myself, call it white supremacy. Fox News has a history of stoking racial divisions. Just take a look at Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, who have used their shows to warn viewers about the \" browning \" of America.\n",

In addition to being a Latina woman, she's calling for bold, progressive initiatives for America that Fox News has deemed socialism.

      "It's a race in which neither VW nor Ford are in lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't see either Ford or VW as currently in a leadership position on autonomous mobility and see them as lagging peers in some areas,\" said Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas. \"On electric vehicles, we see Ford and VW as in the middle of the pack -- not the leader, but not the laggard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ford has already said it plans to spend $11 billion on new technologies and reshaping the focus of the company in the next three to five years. Finding someone to share those kinds of costs with will be crucial to its success. But it has yet to give details of its plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volkswagen officials are similarly tight-lipped, refusing to confirm a report by Reuters that VW CEO Herbert Diess is set to outline a 10-year plan to the company's supervisory board as soon as next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far the only alliance firmly in place between Ford and VW involves an agreement to work together on commercial vehicles. But more is in the works as the companies are in negotiations for additional forms of cooperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent interview with Bloomberg , Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said the companies' discussions are \"broad\" but not limited to any particular technology, product or geography. But some kind of combination or alliance appears inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The companies are clearly a good fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ford's sales and profitability are strong in the United States, but the company is trailing competitors badly in China and continuing to struggle in Europe and Latin America. Volkswagen does well in Europe, China and Latin America but and has never been a major player in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ford's lineup strength is with trucks and SUVs, but it's struggling in luxury cars and is walking way from sedans . Volkswagen is a power-player in sedans and luxury cars -- it owns the Audi brand -- but struggles in light trucks such as pickups and delivery vans.\n",
      "\n",
      "As much as a combination of the two established automakers makes sense, a formal merger will be unlikely, if not impossible, because of the unique nature of each company's ownership structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two classes of stock at Ford give the descendants of founder Henry Ford effective control of the automaker. His great-grandson, Bill Ford Jr., is the current chairman of the company and it's clear the Ford family is unwilling to give up that control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volkswagen has about 20% of its shares owned by the German state of Lower Saxony, where it is based. That's a likely roadblock to a full merger as well said Rebecca Lindland, senior analyst for Cox Automotive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ownership structures of the two companies are the one thing keeping them from a full-on merger,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even without a full merger the two companies can get close enough to operate as a single automaker. Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi have been operating under such an alliance for nearly 20 years, sharing top executives, factories and other assets and holding stakes in one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "VW and Ford could buy joint ownership of a separate company that is working on new technologies such as electric and self-driving cars. GM has set up such a stand-alone company, dubbed Cruise, and has sold stakes in it to Softbank and Honda\n",
      "\n",
      "In August Ford quietly set up its own Autonomous Vehicles stand alone business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As expected and intended, we're receiving significant interest from potential partners and financial investors,\" Ford CEO Jim Hackett told investors last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "These kinds of alliances and joint ventures are the future of the rapidly changing auto industry, said Lindland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're going to see a web of alliances that overlays the industry because we're facing such enormously capital-laden decisions that need to be made,\" she said.\n",
      "New York (CNN Business) Honda and General Motors are teaming up to create a new generation of fully autonomous vehicles. Honda will invest $2 billion over 12 years into GM's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Cruise.\n",
      "\n",
      "GM and Cruise have been building and developing self-driving versions of GM's Chevrolet Bolt EV electric car with plans to deploy a fleet of them for public use next year. With Honda's engineering and financial assistance, Cruise will begin developing a new vehicle that is not based on any existing car, the companies said. It will represent the next step in autonomous driving, one in which controls for human operation are entirely absent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a purpose-built vehicle that will be the first vehicle produced at scale that is freed from the constraints of vehicle design and having a driver at the wheel,\" said GM president Donald Amman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amman gave no precise timing on when Cruise Automation's self-driving vehicles will be shuttling members of the general public, either in the Bolt EV or the new car. The cars will be deployed only when it has been decided they are safe enough, Amman enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Japanese tech-focused investment bank Softbank recently invested $2.25 billion in Cruise , and Honda took a $750 million equity stake. Together, the Honda and Softbank investments give Cruise a total value of $14.6 billion.\n",
